# NumPy for Machine Learning

NumPy (Numerical Python) is the core library used for numerical computing in data science and machine learning.

Machine learning models operate on vectors and matrices rather than individual variables.  
NumPy provides fast array operations that replace slow Python loops.

This section builds the mathematical and array manipulation foundation required before learning Pandas and Machine Learning.

## What You Learn Here

- Working with arrays instead of lists
- Selecting and transforming data
- Mathematical operations on datasets
- Vectorized computation
- Statistical analysis

These concepts directly map to how ML algorithms process data internally.
