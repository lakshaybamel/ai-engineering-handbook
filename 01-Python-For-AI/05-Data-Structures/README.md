# Data Structures in Python

Data structures organize and store data efficiently.  
They are fundamental for Machine Learning because ML works on collections of data rather than single values.

This section covers Python’s built-in data containers and how they are used in real programs.

## Why Data Structures Matter in AI

In Artificial Intelligence we constantly handle structured data:

- dataset rows
- feature columns
- vocabulary words
- JSON responses
- model predictions

Choosing the correct structure improves performance, readability, and correctness.

## Covered Structures

### 1. Strings — Text Data
Used for textual information, preprocessing, and prompts.

📂 [Strings Module](01-Strings)

Topics:
- indexing & slicing
- string methods
- formatting
- text problems

---

### 2. Lists — Ordered Collection
Most commonly used structure for storing sequences and datasets.

📂 [Lists Module](02-Lists)

Topics:
- list operations
- slicing
- methods
- traversal
- list comprehension

---

### 3. Tuples — Fixed Data
Used when data should not change and for returning multiple values.

📂 [Tuples Module](03-Tuples)

Topics:
- immutability
- unpacking
- packing
- tuple methods

---

### 4. Dictionaries — Structured Records
Represents real-world objects using key–value pairs.

📂 [Dictionaries Module](04-Dictionaries)

Topics:
- CRUD operations
- methods
- nested data
- frequency counting

---

### 5. Sets — Unique Elements
Used for filtering, membership testing, and mathematical operations.

📂 [Sets Module](05-Sets)

Topics:
- uniqueness
- set operations
- membership testing

## Learning Outcome

After completing this section you can:

- choose appropriate container for data
- process structured data
- prepare datasets before ML libraries
- understand JSON-like structures

This knowledge forms the foundation before learning NumPy and Pandas.
