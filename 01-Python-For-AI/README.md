# Python for AI Engineering

This section builds the programming foundation required before learning Machine Learning and Deep Learning.

Artificial Intelligence is not about libraries first — it is about problem solving using code.  
Therefore this chapter focuses on writing correct, readable, and structured Python programs.

## What You Will Learn

This module covers complete Python fundamentals from beginner to professional level:

- writing programs
- decision making
- reusable logic
- working with collections
- object oriented design
- handling real files & data
- writing safe programs
- clean Pythonic coding style

The goal is not just to run code, but to think like a developer.
