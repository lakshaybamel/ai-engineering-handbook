# Python Environment Setup

## Why Setup Matters
Before writing any AI or ML code, we need a proper development environment.  
A bad setup leads to version conflicts, missing libraries, and execution errors — which wastes more time than learning itself.

The goal is to create a clean and reproducible workspace.

## Tools Used

### 1. Python
Python is the primary language used in Artificial Intelligence because of:
- simple syntax
- large ML ecosystem
- community support

We install Python and verify installation:

```bash
python --version
```

### 2. VS Code
VS Code acts as our development environment where we:
- write code
- run scripts
- debug errors
- manage extensions

### 3. Important Extensions
Essential extensions:
- Python (Microsoft)
- Pylance (better suggestions)
- Jupyter (for notebooks later)
